Background

I started my career on the engineering side, with a focus on Electrical Engineering and Computer Science but over time I kept getting pulled toward customer-facing work. Through the years I worked with the whole spectrum of different sized companies. From relatively small law and accounting firms to the biggest enterprise customers possible. I was given the opportunity to join these prestigious teams-—figuring out how they operate, what slows them down, what their tech stack actually looks like in the wild, and where the real friction points are. In gaining this understanding of 'their' world I quickly realized that solving businees issues is not about how elegant your code is but how much value it delivers.
